  <title>Sebastian's First Website</title>
  <body bgcolor="blue">
  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>Welcome to my web page! This is the first example from class. I hope you like it.
  <p>Here's another paragraph.
  I typed this line without another paragraph tag, so it should appear right next to the previous 
  sentence. The web page doesn't preserve the same spacing. It formats according to the tag it sees.
  So the line
  breaks
  are
  
  
  
  
  
  different
  from the
  source
  also. <p><h2>But here's a <i>new</i> paragraph.</h2>
  <br><br><br>And a couple more blank lines afterward...
    <p>Here is a website to watch <a href="https://home.nflbite.com/">NFL Games</a>
